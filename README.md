# CucumberSample001
A sample project to test web application using Cucumber framework.

**Step 01**

1. Create a Cucumber feature file
2. Create StepDefinitions file
3. Create a Junit Runner class to run this feature.
4. Instead of WebDriver, use WebDriverManager, so that selenium automatically manages the Webdriver based on the browser type and browser version.
